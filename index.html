            Dr. Sarabhai was considered as the Father of the Indian space program;
             He was a great institution builder and established or helped to
              establish a large number of institutions in diverse fields.
               He was instrumental in establishing the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad : 
               after returning from Cambridge to an independent India in 1947, 
               he persuaded charitable trusts controlled by his family and 
               friends to endow a research institution near home in Ahmedabad.
                Thus, Vikram Sarabhai founded the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad on November 11, 1947. 
                He was only 28 at that time. Sarabhai was a creator and cultivator of institutions and PRL was the first step in that direction.
             Vikram Sarabhai served of PRL from 1966-1971.</p>
